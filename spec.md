# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [X] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application -if you run ./bin/recipe-search it will show you different food categories to choose a recipe from
- [X] Pull data from an external source - the source is http://foodrecipesearch.com
- [X] Implement both list and detail views - I show the different food categories, followed by the recipes in that category, and finally the recipe itself

# RecipeSearch

Welcome to the Recipe Search gem. This application will show you several different types of recipe categories to choose from (Vegan, Seafood, Beef, Baby, etc) and then the recipes found under each
category. You can select the recipe you want and it will give you the name, time it takes to make the meal, the ingredients and the directions.

After you have viewed the recipe, you may type exit or type list or back to get the recipe list again or choose from a different food category.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'recipe_search'

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install recipe_search
